      <p>What is it?</p>
      <p> Gender Education Disparity is the imbalance between sexes regarding enrollment, dropout rates, and survival rates pertaining to education. Predominantly in developing countries, gender disparities in education occur when one gender is disadvantaged over the other in terms of schooling. In these areas, females enrolled in schools and the workforce are significantly lower while the percentage of males recieving formal education remains high. </p>
