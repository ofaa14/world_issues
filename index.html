              <p>What is it?</p>
              <p>Climate Change is any long-term change in the expected patterns of average weather of a region over a significant period of time. Some examples include; changes in solar output and volcanism. Several human activities are presently driving driving climate change through global warming.</p>

                                <p> Pollution is the addition of any substance or form of energy to the environment at a rate faster than it can be dispersed or stored in a harmless form. It is mostly caused by the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, natural gas and gasoline (which is used to produce electricity and power vehicles).

                                      <p>Gender education disparity is the imbalance between sexes regarding enrollment, dropout rates, and survival rates pertaining to education. Predominantly in developing countries, gender disparities in education occur when one gender is disadvantaged over the other in terms of schooling. In these areas, females enrolled in schools and the workforce are significantly lower while the percentage of males recieving formal education remains high. </p>

It is mostly caused by the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, natural gas and gasoline (that is used to produce electricity and power vehicles).

It is a multifaceted concept, which may include social, economic, and political elements. The unequal distrubution of wealth in countries is the most pronounced, it's been leading to the poverty we see today. These people in 1st world countries tend to work minimum wage jobs. Those in third world countries tend to work in sweatshops for little pay.</p>
